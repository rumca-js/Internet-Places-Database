However, none of it is labeled: We want to make this enormous repository useful to researchers. We have found that researchers are often looking for 'hard' signals - specific call-types, birds with very little available training data, and so on. So we built an acoustic-similarity search tool, allowing researchers to provide an example of what they're looking for, which we then match against embeddings from the A2O dataset.<p>Here's some fun examples!<p>Laughing Kookaburra: <<a href=\"https://search.acousticobservatory.org/search/index.html?q=https://api.search.acousticobservatory.org/api/v1/a2o/audio_recordings/download/flac/372176?start_offset%3D25%26end_offset%3D30\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://search.acousticobservatory.org/search/index.html?q=h...</a>><p>P",
