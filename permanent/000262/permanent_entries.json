The Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), in 2015, began its initiative to provide financial support to Colleges and Universities across the USA in becoming more inclusive in the way that students are engaged in learning, with a particular emphasis on institutions addressing racial inequities that continue to marginalize students of color in STEM. In 2017 the first cohort of HHMI IE schools were announced, and Kalamazoo received the grant with the second cohort in 2018. To the extent that STEM departments discover how to be more inclusive, this work has the potential to permeate other disciplines at an institution, hence making the entire institution more inclusive.",
